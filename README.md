**Mental Health in Tech Survey: Predictive Analysis**ðŸ“Š 
Project Overview:
This repository contains the code and report for an MSc Data Science project focused on predicting mental health treatment-seeking 
behavior among professionals in the technology sector. 
Utilizing a comprehensive survey dataset, this study develops and evaluates machine learning models to identify key factors influencing these decisions.
**Key Features & FindingsPredictive Modeling:** 
Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
**Top Performer:** Achieved a maximum cross-validation accuracy of 69.58% with the Gradient Boosting model.
**Key Predictors:** Identified family history, availability of company benefits, knowledge of care options, age group,
and work interference as the most significant factors influencing treatment-seeking.
**Actionable Insights:** Provides data-driven recommendations for tech companies to enhance mental health support systems and inform policy.
